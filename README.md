# Welcome to Project Stars!

<br>

### The project

This repository contains our project called **"Project Stars"**. We created it as our university research project, at the DHBW in Stuttgart (Germany). "Project Stars" is a web application that let's you organize your bookmarks - in every browser, on every device, in every way you want to.

### Tech stuff

This repository contains the source code of both the back- and frontend.

- User data is stored within a **NoSQL MongoDB**.
- The backend runs on top of **Node.js** and provides a **REST API** for communication purposes, realized with **ExpressJS**.
- The frontend is build on top of **Angular 2** (version RC.1), completely written in **TypeScript**. Moreover, **Redux** (for a flux data flow) and **Immutable.JS** (for immutable data structures) are being used.
- The UI design was created from scratch, using **SASS** as a CSS preprocessor. In addition, all styles follow a **BEM** naming convention and the architecture is based on **ITCSS**.
- **Gulp** tasks are responsible for task automations, e.g. building for development & production. Both **SystemJS** and **Webpack** solve module loading for different environments.
