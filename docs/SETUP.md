# How to setup this application

This application was developed on machines running either Windows or Linux. Therefore the setup guide includes instructions for both operating systems.

### Step 1: Install and configure tools

Before we can really start, we need to download and configure some software / tools. All of the following installations are required, the order doesn't matter.

* Install Git ([Windows](/setup/01_git_windows.md) - [Linux (TODO)]())
* Install NodeJS ([Windows](/setup/01_nodejs_windows.md) - [Linux (TODO)]())
* Install MongoDB ([Windows](/setup/01_mongodb_windows.md) - [Linux (TODO)]())

> Earlier versions of this project required an installation of Ruby as well as Bundler. Both of them are no longer necessary.
