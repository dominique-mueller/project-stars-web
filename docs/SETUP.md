# How to setup this application

This application was developed on machines running either Windows or Linux. Therefore the setup guide includes instructions for both operating systems.

In short: You need to install and configure Git, NodeJS as well as MongoDB on your machine, clone the repository, install the NPM dependencies and run the build process.

### Step 1: Install and configure tools

Before we can really start, we need to download and configure some software / tools. All of the following installations are required, the order doesn't matter.

* Install Git ([Windows](/setup/01_git_windows.md) - [Linux (TODO)]())
* Install NodeJS ([Windows](/setup/01_nodejs_windows.md) - [Linux (TODO)]())
* Install MongoDB ([Windows](/setup/01_mongodb_windows.md) - [Linux (TODO)]())

> Earlier versions of this project required an installation of Ruby as well as Bundler. But for now they're no longer necessary.

### Step 2: Setup the application

It's time. It's finally time to get our application running. Follow the instructions in order to download and setup the application. All steps are required for both development and production environments.

* [Download the source code](/setup/02_download.md)
* [Install dependencies](/setup/02_dependencies.md)
* [Run the build process](/setup/02_build.md)

### Step 3: Run the app

It's simple. It's easy. Simply run `node app` in the project root folder and visit the localhost to see the application.

**Note:**

You can't register (yet), you can only login. Existing username-password combinations are: TODO.
